## Dave Intro
Hey, Dave here. If you have any questions or enquiries on any of the applications/websites/games that I make, don't be afraid to give me a message on discord @daviddedank6.
I am currently learning different programming languages and making small projects along the way. So, if you can, have a look at what I make and let me know if its any good :D
